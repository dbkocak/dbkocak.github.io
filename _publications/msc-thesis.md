excerpt: This thesis develops a **hierarchical Bayesian GLMM** for vehicle **interfailure times**, validated via **posterior predictive checks**. We then use a **Monte Carlo approximation** within an **MDP** to support **policy-making for workforce optimization** in maintenance planning.

Vehicles that operate under demanding conditions need an understanding of failures
to ensure reliability and take appropriate actions. To address this, a statistical
framework is developed for modeling failure times using real-world operational
data. The approach employs Bayesian Generalized Linear Mixed Models
to capture unit and vehicle-level effects, and intervention effects. A sequential
simulation framework models temporal dependencies and generates multi-step
failure predictions with full uncertainty quantification. The proposed model and
simulation approach are evaluated to demonstrate both calibration and predictive
performance. Additionally, the work shows how predictive outputs can inform
decision-making by deriving new system-level metrics and assessing their reliability.
Finally, the results are applied in a representative sequential decision-making
problem on workforce planning for repair actions.
